Receiving continuous updates to your environment can be done with ease using WSO2 recommended configuration management tools, which are Puppet and Ansible.<br>
listed below are the steps:

1. Go to the desired git repository location of the selected configuration management tool.
   [e.g., Let say we are using WSO2 APIM with ansible as the configuration management tool, thus the git repo to refer is `https://github.com/wso2/ansible-apim` ]
2. Clone the correct git repo
3. Checkout the latest tag of the product version.
   
      
         git checkout <version of the latest tag>
      

!!! info
      The above commend will be like ``git checkout v2.6.0.7`` for the latest WSO2 APIM 2.6.0 version


4.Move to the `scripts` directory and run the `update.sh` in the main node.


         cd scripts
         ./update.sh
      

   
5.After the product is updated, propagate the updated product pack to the relevant environments. (i.e. Development, Staging and Production)
